## Background

A program which can report the information about COVID-19 automatically. The user can avoid forgetting to report information because the program finishes what he must to do at 10 o'clock everyday. 

> Warning: the program can only report the default information that you 're healthy and there is no risk of exposure to COVID-19.

## Install

This project uses [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) mainly . Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

## Usage

You should prepare two file, user.csv and email.csv . One contains user data and the other contains email date. Because it involves user privacy, I don't  upload these two files. If you need them, please contact me.
